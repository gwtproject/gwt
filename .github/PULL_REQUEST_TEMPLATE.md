Thanks for your contribution to the GWT Project!

Please make sure your pull request has a short, concise title, and a
clear description that can be used as a commit message for the entire
pull request when it is squashed into a single commit.

The message should end with a reference to the github issue being
addressed in this pull request, e.g. "Fixes #42" to close the linked
issue, or "Partial #42" to indicate that this merge will address it,
but that it isn't ready to be closed yet.
