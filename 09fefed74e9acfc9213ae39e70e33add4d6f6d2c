      "message": "@Brian: Although we included the annotations.jar in our distribution, we would have to add the className literal to the array of configurations because it\u0027s not in the default WebAppContext.__dftConfigurationClasses. So this setup would be very similar except from the class.forName exception.\n\nRelated with adding the .jar I don\u0027t think it\u0027s necessary to overweight gwt-dev.jar unless there are people demanding it. The message is clear enough and anyone using this feature can add the dependency by hand.\nAnyway if we decide to include it I would do in a different patch since we need first update gwt_tools",
