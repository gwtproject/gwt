      "message": "It looks like previously we were detecting cycles of size one (a node that points to itself) and the result of this change is that we\u0027ll detect cycles of size two. Is there some reason we know that we\u0027ll never have cycles of more than two nodes? Or should we use a more general cycle-detection algorithm? We could\nsolve the general case by keeping a HashSet of previously seen nodes and doing a set lookup.",
