Splitting attr value into multiple lines would make it much more readable, but it does seem to require a differently named child element for the standard javac children as far as I could tell.\n\nThoughts on landing the java7 removal first, and then pursuing one of these? \n\nMy primary concern is that in order to update to recent htmlunit/jetty, we must drop java7, and I\u0027m unsure how that will interact with the existing Jenkins - while the last set of shared jenkins configs say that Java 8 is being used to run all tests, I can\u0027t reproduce that so far.",
