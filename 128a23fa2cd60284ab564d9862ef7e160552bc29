      "message": "Well, the question is whether we lean towards GitHub\u0027s or Gerrit\u0027s style.\n\nThe \"Bug:\" footer has the advantage that it allows searching for reviews using the \"tr:\" operator (well, except that it doesn\u0027t work when the issue number is prefixed with a #, at least as currently configured on this Gerrit instance); this should surface only reviews fixing that bug (contrary to a grep on \"#9308\" which would also give commits with messages referencing the issue, without necessarily being about the issue; e.g. \"as discussed in comments of #9308\").\n\nI, for one, don\u0027t quite like the GitHub style because it\u0027s easy to have false positives (\"partially fixes #xxx\", or \"note that, while similar, it does not fix #xxx\") and false negatives. There\u0027s also the more general handling of issues: ReviewPending label is not removed, Milestone might have not been set, or would need to be updated, etc. Those things can be automated, but not by GitHub directly (needs a bot/webhook), so the GitHub \"formalism\" doesn\u0027t really help (the stricted Gerrit one is easier to handle).",
