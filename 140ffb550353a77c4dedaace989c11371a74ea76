      "message": "Comparing floats exactly is a dangerous thing -- particularly since JS doesn\u0027t have a float type, and everything gets represented as double.  Also, some JS interpreters steal bits from floats for tag bits.\n\nI suggest using only fractions that are small powers of 2, such as .5 and .25 for tests like this.",
