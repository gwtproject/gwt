What this currently does is:\n\n* return true in \"classic dev mode\" (currently, that should only be the case of GWTTestCase, as everyone is expected to have moved to SuperDevMode for in-browser testing during development)\n* return false in \"prod mode\" (and SDM)\n* crash in a JVM when not in \"dev mode\".\n\nI know we\u0027re in a \"javaemul\" package in the \"dev/core/super/\" source root, but still.\n\nisClassicDevMode? isLegacyDevMode? or switch the return value and call it isScript? isProdMode?\n\nAnd/or maybe move that class inside \"user/test-super/\" ?",
