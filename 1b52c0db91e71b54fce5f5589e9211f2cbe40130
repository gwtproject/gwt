      "message": "Isn\u0027t this kind of iteration pretty common?  Also we would probably want to translate for (O o : array) to simple for (o in array).\n\nSomehow I think we better not patch the Array prototype. After all it is done only to respond that it is a GWT java object and to implement EQ? Maybe handle in the places where used.",

      "message": "Although it is not the best way to do iterations,  we might be more likely see this kind of usage in arrays. So I would prefer to not break any existing (or future) javascript code by this change.\n\nIn the previous patch I suggested arrays to work like JSOs for the purpose of method dispatch and Daniel said he is going to look into that. Perhaps we should do it before submitting this patch?\n\nRoberto: defineProperty is not supported in ie8",
