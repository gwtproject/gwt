      "message": "It seems it was thought to build the project using both maven or ant.\nSo I have left it to be coherent or to reuse it if we wanted to maintain both build methods.\n\nIn fact the tree maven projects here have never built by the CI server nor the packaging script, mobilemail build was broken and, and presumably validation was, and that was the reason I tried to fix builds with ant, but that implies more script maintenance.\n\nAt the end I\u0027d rather add these 3 projects as news builds in CI, and even, we could consider build ant projects independently instead of in the gwt build.",
