      "message": "Actually the group of client/ui, user/cellview, gwt/cell, gwt/editor, gwt/view was the most annoying part for me and I basically gave up after playing with it mostly.\n\nOne of the major reasons that I gave up on this is mostly because I don\u0027t see any of these being used in new-world and don\u0027t see much benefit on spending time with it. I consider depending on one of these piece is living in \"old-world\" and it\u0027s a simple to understand dependency for those apps: c.g.gwt.user.UI.\n\nOn the other hand, I trust your judgement on these parts you can ahead group the way you want them, just try not to break anything :)",
