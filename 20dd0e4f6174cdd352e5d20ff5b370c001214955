      "message": "Yes. Sorry about that. The whole patch just fixes an issue with the error reporting. I had a misconception of log.branch  (I though it would emit the error message if there where submessages) so the previous patch was emitting \"Errors in Blah\"  for every class that had JSNI.\n\nSo I decided to reuse the login in JsInteropRestrictionChecker and that not only solves the issue but also improves the error logging.\n\nI could make JsniRestrictionChecker a subclass itself to make it consistent with the other (I sort of dislike the pattern where the class has a static entry point that creates an instance of itself that is not exposed.)",
