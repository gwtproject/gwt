      "message": "Actually, that behavior is not that important (now that DevMode is deprecated and everyone should use SDM, which will overwrite the file unconditionally, I think we can accept that \"old DevMode\" also overwrites unconditionally, particularly if it goes away just after 2.8); what matters is that currently the mtime of the nocache.js is based only on the XML files so in many cases the content of the nocache.js changes (because permutation names change) but the mtime stays the same, breaking any HTTP conditional request based on the mtime.\n\nI think it\u0027s acceptable that we always use \u0027now\u0027 as the lastModified value of the nocache.js, and always overwrite the file.",

But given that each round of changes for this has made some users or tests unhappy (but only amonst open source users and not amongst interal Google users) and the only known-good version was the original, i\u0027d rather not make any changes.\n\nWould like to treat it as a pure rollback.",
