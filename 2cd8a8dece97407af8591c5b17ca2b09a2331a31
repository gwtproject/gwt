      "message": "The actual problem in HtmlUnit seems that in test testReplaceItemNoEvent when adding a new history token with fire event set to false, the event is not fired during the test, but some time after, when testEmptyHistoryTokens is running.\nI have tried to catch this event in the test itself to demonstrate that htmlunit is buggy, but although I increased the delay the event is never fired during this test but in the next one.\nFor some reason registering a new item in the tear-down all those pending events seems to go out.\nMy first idea was to disable testReplaceItemNoEvent in htmlunit, but I\u0027d rather continue running the test.",
