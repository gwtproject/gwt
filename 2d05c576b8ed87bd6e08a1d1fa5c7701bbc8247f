It\u0027s horrible and we should clean that up but it\u0027s a separate patch and not needed for 2.7.\n\nIn other code we are passing \"values\" as a function parameter for clarity but it doesn\u0027t seem worth doing here. Maybe add a comment that \"values\" is a magic variable provided by __PROPERTY_PROVIDERS__?",
