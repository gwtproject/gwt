I think we should handle this more gracefully and also ideally even avoid performing conversion in the first place (e.g. one might avoid fixing the css and puts a replacement gss; we don\u0027t want to print all the errors in the css).\nThis should be easy to do by moving convertFile call into this method.\nWhat do you think?",
