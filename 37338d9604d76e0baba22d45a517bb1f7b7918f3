I can write that kind of code (and I know a few generators, e.g. Dagger, that *will* do it; and GWTQuery uses a class named \u0027$\u0027):\n\n package foo;\n\n public class Bar$Baz {\n   static class Qux$Quux { }\n }\n\n(and you can actually do much worse: https://twitter.com/shs96c/status/505066256643670016)\n\nFor the top-level class, getName() and getCanonicalName() would both be \"foo.Bar$Baz\", and getSimpleName() \"Bar$Baz\". For the inner class, getName() would be \"foo.Bar$Baz$Qux$Quux\", getCanonicalName() \"foo.Bar$Baz.Qux$Quux\", and getSimpleName() \"Qux$Quux\".\n\nThe real fix (that I believe was proposed a while ago and never merged) is to pass the information to the factory-methods.",
