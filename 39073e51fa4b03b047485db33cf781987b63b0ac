      "message": "Just did that. After tweaking Dependencies.java to make it compatible with the test, the tests passed.\n\nThe tweak was that I call getApiRefs() instead of directly accessing the field apiRefs in the method findMissingApiRefs. It just works around an imperfection in the manual mocks I created in the test.",
