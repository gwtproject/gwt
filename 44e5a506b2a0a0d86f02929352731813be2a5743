      "message": "It seems like we\u0027d want to interleave the repeating and scheduled commands in the same order they were queued.  Is there any reason not to do that?  As is, it seems like if a RepeatingCommand where to schedule another ScheduledCommand, it would end up getting run still, contrary to the docs.\n\nAlso, are there scenarios where you only want to execute repeating or scheduled commands, but not both?",

      "message": "Interleaving the calls like the real implementation would require a new implementation of this class, since its current behavior is to treat repeating and scheduled commands separately. I don\u0027t know why this behavior was chosen, but we have to deal with it...\n\nIn practice I guess that the few classes which mix up commands and rely on the specific behavior should test with a real Scheduler.\n\nDocumented the odd behavior regarding RepeatingCommand scheduling another ScheduledCommand.",
