First, I figured out why we had the duplicate entries in the `org.gwtproject:gwt` pom - I was supposed to change the groupId of the second entry, but failed to do so, and only noticed this when I updated a project to use only `org.gwtproject` groupIds.\n\nThe samples have also been updated to use the new groupId and an updated version of the net.ltgt plugin for gwt.",
