      "message": "When we talked about this before, we decided we couldn\u0027t easily catch everything that would throw an NPE.  I suggest you need to cover pretty much every case and test for it, such as array derefs, method calls, etc.\n\nOne big problem is that any method calls that get devirtualized and inlined will not result in an NPE, but will just have \"this\" be null.  If you want to catch those, you would have to test this inside the called method.",

      "message": "Ok, I just wonder if a 60% solution is much of an improvement.\n\nI also recall a patch which does the same devmode checks as this (Stephen Haberman, perhaps?) that was never landed because it turned out that people were making use of the fact that devirtualized/inlined calls could be called on null this in some cases, and it broke the code.  Personally, I don\u0027t think that is sufficient reason to avoid it though.",
