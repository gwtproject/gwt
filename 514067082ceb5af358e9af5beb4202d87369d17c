      "message": "When we talked about this before, we decided we couldn\u0027t easily catch everything that would throw an NPE.  I suggest you need to cover pretty much every case and test for it, such as array derefs, method calls, etc.\n\nOne big problem is that any method calls that get devirtualized and inlined will not result in an NPE, but will just have \"this\" be null.  If you want to catch those, you would have to test this inside the called method.",

Personally, I don\u0027t think that is sufficient reason to avoid it though.",

But I also know DevMode is on the way out anyway. So, dunno, I\u0027m ambivalent at this point.",

      "message": "Yes let\u0027s bring your CL back to life to fix devmode correctly. Calling an instance method on null is not intuitive and the in the (probably few) places it is used I suppose it can be worked around easily. \n\nAlso invoking a method on a null dualImpl JSO throws a JS TypeError due to testing whether is a JavaObject or not. So having the same semantics for both cases would be a sane option.",
