      "message": "I ran into scoping problems in more complex scenarios.  When assigning one instance to a variable of a JsType, then invoking a defender method (which in turn called another defender method), the this reference was mistakenly pointing to the outer scope.  I fixed this by checking x.getInstance() and only using a JThisRef when it was unqualified (JNullLiteral).\n\nI\u0027m pretty sure the cause was that I was assigning to an instance and then referencing that; when the invocation is attached to a constructor invocation, the JThisRef points to the correct place, but when it\u0027s a regular variable reference, it points to the containing scope.\n\nI also added support for rewriting jsni references to defender methods so I could effectively write a web component builder that would let me define JsType interfaces with default methods that can be automatically bound to a new prototype. :D\n\nHere\u0027s a commit with my work in gwt-core.\n\nhttps://github.com/WeTheInternet/gwt-sandbox/compare/gwtproject:beada220792bcb281d81452beec903bcd4b3ae3e...defender-methods",
