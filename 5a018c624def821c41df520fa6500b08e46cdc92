      "message": "I have no other information then the related change; which says:\n\n\"Adds pre-deserialization type checking for values in GWT RPC messages.\nThe server will now avoid deserializing types that mismatch the RPC\nmethod that is being invoked, reducing the chance that an erroneous\nmessage will cause uncaught deserialization errors on the server.\"\n\nIt looks like it is for better error messaging. I think LogRecord should not be sent from server to client in the first place. Anyway, I can revert my change if you don\u0027t feel comfortable.",
