They\u0027re more like ReferenceIdentityMap.\n\nThere are a couple other cases of ReferenceMap with weak keys (ResourceOracleImpl and CorrelationFactory), though I\u0027m almost sure the move to identity-equality doesn\u0027t break anything (keys are ClassLoader, ResourceLoader, JDeclaredType, JField and JMethod).",
