      "message": "It won\u0027t be called in the current impl, but consider implementing this anyway so it could be? \n\ncollect(supplier, accumulator, combiner) passes the combiner (in a lambda) to Collector.of as combiner into collect(Collector), which calls reduce(identity, accumulator, combiner), which doesn\u0027t presently use it. I\u0027m not certain, but it seems that ought to remove Collector.combiner() if used nowhere, and in turn this lambda, even if fully implemented?",

      "message": "I think it is best to minimize the implementation since the stream APIs are quite heavy for web use right now.\n\nSince combiners are for parallelization I think we should consider removing all combiners but just keep the param for compatibility since I don\u0027t foresee using them ever for web (at least until we come up with a good use case).",
