If protobuf is needed at runtime, then it should go into gwt-servlet (as it\u0027s rebased); otherwise (which I believe is the case) it should be removed from gwt-servlet-deps (shouldn\u0027t have been added in the first place).\n\nAnd the reason for moving the Guava line up was, I think, to make sure there\u0027s no conflict with Guava classes that were erroneously present in other JARs.",
