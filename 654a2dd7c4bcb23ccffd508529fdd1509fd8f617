      "message": "I\u0027m not sure how much we should worry about server-side performance here, but here are some ideas:\n\n- Pattern.compile() should be moved to a constant.\n- We should have another method that skips scanning the string and call that where possible. For example, addToken(int) should skip the scan. There is also a path from writeLong that should probably skip it.\nIdeally we should move the string concatenation generating code so we don\u0027t need to scan to figure out what we already did.",
