      "message": "These 4 JSNI functions are not using JSNI field refs to Object, so I assume the __elementTypeId$ won\u0027t be obfuscated.\n\nIt would be better to put these fields on Array or Object, and then use array.@java.lang.Object::__elementTypeId  or array.@com.google.gwt.lang.Array::__elementTypeId.\n\nOtherwise, they become unresolvable JsNameRef\u0027s that are not obfuscatable IIRC.\n\nTechnically, you can put them on any helper object that is guaranteed to be instantiable and just do @a.b.c::field. Putting them on Array is probably best.",
