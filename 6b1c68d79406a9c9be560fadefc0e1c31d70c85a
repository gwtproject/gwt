      "message": "This is a public API change (for generators). In particular, there was nothing to stop someone from subclassing JavaSourceCategory to create new categories, but that\u0027s not possible for a real Java enum.\n\nI doubt the advanced functionality is used much; it\u0027s not used at all for Google.\n\nStill, it seems like we should deprecate Enum and the JavaSourceCategory constructor for a release before making this change?",

      "message": "Although the class is public, it is not practical to refer to it because it is only used in two places; a private field inside ClassSourceFileComposerFactory and the package protected ClassSourceFileComposer; both are hidden from outside.\n\nSo only possible breakage scenario is, if someone extends the class and use it for the purposes outside of this package which is very unlikely. (Probably we should also change the visibility to package visible).\n\nSo I think we can just take the shortcut here and not wait for an extra release to get rid of the code.",
