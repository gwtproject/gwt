      "message": "Right, but I would argue that your JsType / JSNI is wrong then and you should have used double as return value or coerce the value to int on JS side. When coming from JS the developer is responsible to choose the correct Java type.\n\nIf we change int/long variants to use NativeMath then a possible NaN input will always be returned and propagates further as \"wrong\" int/long. \nIf we don\u0027t change it here then NaN will never be selected assuming the other argument is a valid int/long. Then the return value is at least of correct type even though the result might be unexpected. If both arguments are NaN then NaN propagates through again.\n\nNot sure which approach is better. Not that I am against it, just thinking about the consequences.",
