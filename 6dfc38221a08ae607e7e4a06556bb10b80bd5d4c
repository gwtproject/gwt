      "message": "System.exit() seems kind of drastic. It\u0027s probably okay for Blaze, but in general we don\u0027t know which JVM is running the JUnit tests or what else we\u0027re going to kill as a side effect. It seems like we should send a message reporting a fatal error to the message queue, so that all remaining GWTTestCases fail immediately and then the JUnit test runner shuts down in an orderly way (after running all non-GWTTestCases in the test suite). Perhaps you could write a method similar to JUnitMessageQueue.reportFatalLaunch()?",
