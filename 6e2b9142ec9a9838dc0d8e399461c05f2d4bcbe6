      "message": "Is this logic correct? The allButN is dependencies which are alive NOT in this split point, but the allFromSplitPoints are ones wich are alive in this split point. \n\nThe final result is, a method is live if it has a dependency in AllNodes, but not in AllButN, and it is also in AllFromSplitPoint.",

      "message": "You are right, I misread updateReverseMap. computeAllLiveFromSplitpoints should not record the dependencies.\n\nBut then the report would be only partially correct. IIRC the only reason the soyc report gives for a certain atom not being in a certain fragment is that it has dependency on some other atom that is on some other fragment, right? \n\nI was thinking of getting a good enough report and leaving a full overhaul for when the new fragment merging strategy is implemented.\n\nWhat do you think?",
