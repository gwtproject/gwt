      "message": "Since instanceof ArrayType is called much rarer in Javascript, I feel we should invert these conditions. RegularJavaObject is probably the most frequent case, with String, then JSO, then Arrays last.\n\nThis could really degrade collection performance for example, with every hashCode()/equals() call requiring a double conditional evaluation, whereas it could early exit in the majority of cases.\n\nTODO: try to come up with a way to avoid calling Cast.instanceOfArray twice in the same expression. (compiler won\u0027t do CSE on it, maybe closure would?)",

      "message": "To detect that smthng is a RegularJavaObject we need to test that it has typeMarker (or the castmap) AND check that is not an array (as those also have typeMarker and castMap.\n\nWe could possible do away removing the typeMarker on arrays.\n\nThe regular string test (typeof \u003d\u003d \"string\") is very fast (compared to checking the typeMarker) and most of the strings in GWT (if not all) are not boxed. I wonder if any of these devirtualized functions are called very ofter for strings (if so it would make sense to split the string test in two)\n\nI will rewrite the devirtualizer so that it is easier to explore the different alternatives.",
