Let\u0027s either abolish the run-in-jvm tests and make LongEmul a JSO Overlay Type, or make sure when RUN_IN_JVM runs, it never touches any of the JSNI paths (wihich should already be true)\n\nI don\u0027t understand the rationale of the original author for making a JVM class, and then stashing JSO expando properties on it, in effect, making it both a JVM and JSO class.  Since they are already special casing the paths, they could have used an interface and hid the JRE and JSO impls behind it.",
