For comparison INFO by itself is used magnitudes more than the total of all these together in Google.\nWe need to put a line somewhere since this is not free in draft. You can still set log level programmatically and I never seen people went into production with even INFO level so I think this is fine.",

      "message": "Yeah wasn\u0027t precise. With SPAM I meant the amount of logging when choosing ALL. Basically the amount of logging between INFO and ALL can be pretty huge and developers might want to have something in between. Of course they won\u0027t do this for production compiles but I can see some use for it in QA builds or special debug builds. \n\nFor example I would almost never want FINEST in any build except during development as it is often used inside loops or method entry/exit. However CONFIG, FINE, FINER might have valuable debug information. Personally I like the log levels of SLF4J more because there is only DEBUG (equals CONFIG, FINE, FINER) and TRACE (equals FINEST). But I don\u0027t think we want to provide some \"logical\" log levels that combine java.util.logging log levels, do we?\n\nAnyways, its just a suggestion.",
