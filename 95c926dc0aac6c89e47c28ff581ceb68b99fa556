      "message": "I have a hard time reading those tests as I don\u0027t understand the edge cases being tested here. Could comments maybe make things clearer?\n\nAlso, the tests could possible be rewritten in terms of a single call to an assertFormatInTimeZone(Date d, String tz, String expected) method. E.g.\n\n public void testDstStartAndFixedDateDoesntSwitchDst() {\n   // add a comment here explaining what transformation happens,\n   // and why we\u0027re expecting what we\u0027re expecting.\n   assertFormatInTimeZone(\n     new Date(Date.UTC(2016, 2, 13, 10, 0, 0)),\n     TimeZone.createTimeZone(10 * 60),\n     \"Sun, 13 Mar 2016 00:00:00 -1000\");\n }",

      "message": "This is a JUnit 4 thing; so either the test should be JUnit 4 all the way (no \"extends TestCase\", @Test on test methods, and I believe Google would like a @RunWith to tell their build tool that it\u0027s a JUnit 4 testcase; but that\u0027d be the very first JUnit 4 test in the whole GWT codebase), or it should only use JUnit 3 features (setUp/tearDown would work just as well here).\n\nBTW, relying on, and changing, global state like the default timezone is brittle. We know that tests are run in the America/Los_Angeles timezone (some other tests depend on it), so can tests be rewritten to take that into account instead of changing the default timezone? (I know you noted in the commit message that it wouldn\u0027t be possible, but as said above, I don\u0027t have a clear understanding what cases are actually being tested here so…)",
