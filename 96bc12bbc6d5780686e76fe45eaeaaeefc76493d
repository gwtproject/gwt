      "message": "I wonder: given that hasKey(), remove(), get() and put() don\u0027t use hasOwnProperty, and the map is supposed to be an Object.create(null), do we really need to test hasOwnProperty here at all? Couldn\u0027t we simply remove the test in both keys() and values()?",

      "message": "Yes, technically we could do this. I think I need to re-evaluate the Object.create(null) trick. The original idea was to have a true map that doesn\u0027t need a key prefix to avoid collisions and have a pure get/put that works.\n\nThe idea in Elemental is that these primitive interfaces can be cross-cast. e.g. element.getAttributes() could be cast to JsMapFromStringToString, and you could just operate on the values like any other map. Likewise, a JsonObject could be cast to JsMapFromStringToString (unsafely). So a {x: \"foo\", y:\"bar\"} object literal could be both a JsonObject and a JsMapFromStringToString.\n\nThus, in the latter case, we still need the hasOwnProperty checks, because the object may be created by cross-cast elsewhere.",
