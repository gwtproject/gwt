This is not required here at all, as the validateTransportableType is always called with a new RequestContext.Builder for parameters, and we don\u0027t support EntityProxyId as a return type yet.\n\nIf you\u0027re not keen on making these changes, then maybe add a TODO here, for when we\u0027ll add support for EntityProxyId as a return type.",
