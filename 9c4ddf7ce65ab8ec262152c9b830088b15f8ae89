      "message": "\"mvn install\" is an anti-pattern. Its only \"acceptable\" usage is:\n* to actually install a lib so you can use it in another project (similar to deploying, but local-only)\n* in multi-module projects, as a workaround for plugins that don\u0027t play well with reactor builds (e.g. jetty-maven-plugin, and possibly appengine-maven-plugin; but we\u0027re not in a multi-project here so that doesn\u0027t apply)\n\nIf you want to run all tests and integration tests, use \"mvn verify\" and don\u0027t mess with your local repository (and as a nice though limited side effect, save some disk space).\n\nHere the instructions are about \"running\" the project, so it should just be \"mvn package\" or \"mvn war:exploded\".",
