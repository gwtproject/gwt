      "message": "\"mvn install\" is an anti-pattern. Its only \"acceptable\" usage is:\n* to actually install a lib so you can use it in another project (similar to deploying, but local-only)\n* in multi-module projects, as a workaround for plugins that don\u0027t play well with reactor builds (e.g. jetty-maven-plugin, and possibly appengine-maven-plugin; but we\u0027re not in a multi-project here so that doesn\u0027t apply)\n\nIf you want to run all tests and integration tests, use \"mvn verify\" and don\u0027t mess with your local repository (and as a nice though limited side effect, save some disk space).\n\nHere the instructions are about \"running\" the project, so it should just be \"mvn package\" or \"mvn war:exploded\".",

Or maybe it\u0027s just no longer working or too brittle or crappy for whatever reason? Maybe it should be removed from the plugin for GWT then?",

      "message": "I deem using -server appengine no longer working and not effective with a maven configuration. The GPE devs, before me were moving away and wanted to use the Eclipse runtime server instead, which I think is much more effective in most situations to run any backend you want. Although it requires a couple more steps to setup, I\u0027ve got the new GWT Eclipse plugin working very well with it. http://gwt-plugins.github.io/documentation/gwt-eclipse-plugin/servers/AppEngine.html describes how to configure the IDE. \n\nThe real problem is that the old maven plugin was bound to the sdk and there are some issues with unpacking the zip. Instead, using the official Google maven plugin is more effective with the Eclipse server config.",
