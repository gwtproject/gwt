      "message": "Personally I think ever-green browsers that have full typed array support should get the full native version. I don\u0027t think we should hurt performance of ever-green browsers because some old version did not implement everything. \n\nFireFox may have a special role here because of ESR releases, but since FF 15 there are ESR 17, 24 and 31 so I guess it is fine to switch gecko to the full native version.\n\nHowever there is no clearly communicated guideline on supported versions for such ever-green browsers :( We definitely need one. Makes code review easier. \n\nAlternatively we could do a feature check. IE8/9 would map to NoSupportImpl and IE10 to NativeImplEmulClamped via deferred binding. All other would map to NativeImplFull but still do a feature check and maybe fall back on any emulation that is needed at runtime.",
