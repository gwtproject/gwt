      "message": "It is actually unnecessary. I added in response to a comment by Thomas. Initially it seemed that Strings.splitPath() and String.split() might have behaved differently with paths ending in  \"/\" and  the precondition was checking that it was never called with paths ending in \"/\" indirectly. \n\nThat is not the case. I will remove the precondition.",

      "message": "What I said is that, with Strings.splitPath, if you had a path like \"foo//\" (which in itself is highly improbable) it would be split into [\"foo\", \"\"], and with split(\"/\") it\u0027s split into [\"foo\"] (trailing empty strings are trimmed).\n\nBut, as I said, this is an edge-case that will probably never happen, and maybe would have even failed later with the previous implementation.\n\nI think it\u0027s safe to replace splitPath with split, but you have to know that they don\u0027t work exactly the same.",
