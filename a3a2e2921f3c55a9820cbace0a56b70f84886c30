      "message": "Just a thought because RequestFactory inheriting UI looks strange:\n\n   - Make a module for c.g.g.editor.ui and name it for example UiEditor\n   - Make a module for file c.g.g.editor.client.adapters.HasDataEditor and name it HasDataEditor.\n   - Exclude the files from 1.) and 2.) from Editor.gwt.xml and remove the fileset attribute. The Editor module should be compilable on its own now.\n   - Let UiEditor and HasDataEditor modules inherit Editor\n   - Let UI inherit UiEditor (and remove Editor from UI)\n   - Let CellView inherit HasDataEditor (and remove Editor from CellView)\n\nHopefully I haven\u0027t missed anything, but finally you should be able to inherit Editor in RequestFactory and don\u0027t pull in UI stuff.",
