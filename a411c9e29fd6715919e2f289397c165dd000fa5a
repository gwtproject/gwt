      "message": "Looking at this example, the main advantages I see are that (a) you don\u0027t need to define a constructor in this class to enforce its constraints, and (b) we\u0027re restricting the type on the one-argument version of initWidget(), so subclassing is a bit less error-prone. But this will be an internal detail of the class that gets constructed.\n\nBut what if the subclass wants a delegate and RequiresResize at the same time? Then we\u0027re enforcing a constraint on the delegate, not the widget.",
