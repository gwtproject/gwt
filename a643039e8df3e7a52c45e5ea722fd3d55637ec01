      "message": "Done. However I think that the previous example exercises the same code path\n\n  Short n \u003d (short) 1; Object o \u003d n;  boolean b \u003d (boolean) o.\n\ngets translated to \n\n  Short n \u003d (short) 1; Object o \u003d n;  boolean b \u003d (boolean) (Boolean) o.\n\nwhich triggers the ClassCastException. Curiously this happens even for compatible types.\n\n  Short n \u003d (short) 1; Object o \u003d n; int i \u003d (int) o.\n\nas the previous snippet throws a ClassCastException in GWT, eclipse\u0027s Java, openJDK Java which seems surprising.",
