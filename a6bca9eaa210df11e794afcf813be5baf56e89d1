      "message": "We should rather add an accessor for the static field (e.g. hasNativeJsonParse)\n\nAs an alternative, maybe we could use JSNI to access this field and keep it private. This is hack, but it\u0027s only temporary until we remove support for IE6/7 (where we could unconditionally use JsonUtils.safeEval(), and that one would unconditionally use JSON.parse, and that field would disappear).\n\nGiven that hasNativeJsonParse would soon unconditionally return \u0027true\u0027, I\u0027d prefer that we don\u0027t introduce such an API in 2.6 that we\u0027ll deprecate as soon as 3.0.",
