      "message": "I did try that, actually. I had something like [^\\S\\uXXXX\\uXXXX]|[\\uXXXX\\uXXXX]. It worked when I prototyped it in chrome, but didn\u0027t pass the tests.\n\nI think the issue is that some browsers don\u0027t bother with unicode when handling \\s. That\u0027s why ES6 is introducing the \u0027u\u0027 flag for regexes ( https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex ).\n\nSo I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible to make it shorter by using /s; at least not until ES6 support is widespread.",
