I\u0027m not sure how to fix that? I think it would be only necessary when pulling back the code in google3?\n\nI did not use the automatic jre_export.sh script to create this review. Not sure if the j2cl size test is something that script would\u0027ve taken care of automatically.",

However, I was able to generate the gerrit change using probably the old method mentioned in this doc. [1]\n\nCopybara has created this CL - cl/350486051 for the current gerrit change. Here is the cl from my cider client - cl/347674205. Are any of these two cls that you were referring to?\n\n[1] https://docs.google.com/document/d/1olB6J7ajZW8OnQk0OJdx1_G0-pTH3En2C6giSojf7lA/edit#heading\u003dh.iqwpg520jotl",
