I\u0027m seeing this:\nerror loading package \u0027@org_gwtproject_gwt//user\u0027: Extension file not found. Unable to load package for \u0027@org_gwtproject_gwt//third_party/java_src/gwt:build-macros.bzl\u0027: BUILD file not found on package path.\n\nWhat if we just moved these targets under user/super/com/google/gwt/emul/BUILD?\n\nhttps://github.com/gwtproject/gwt/blob/master/user/BUILD#L682\n\nAlternatively, we could just make sure the build-macros.bzl can be resolved when imported under Bazel then we wouldn\u0027t need this change at all.",
