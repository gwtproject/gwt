      "message": "But then there\u0027s no need to re-define the gwt-maven-plugin\u0027s dependencies. So either we use ${gwtVersion} as the gwt-maven-plugin version and we remove the plugin dependencies, or we keep it that way, with identical but \"unrelated\" versions for GWT and the gwt-maven-plugin.\n\nI\u0027d happily go with the former (which would simplify the POM and aligns with what people should write unless they really need different versions of GWT and the plugin â€“ e.g. they use a patched GWT, or a patched plugin, or the plugin hasn\u0027t yet been released for the version of GWT they want to use, or the plugin has had a bugfix release), but it makes it a bit harder to test the WebAppCreator with a GWT RC (not yet pushed to Central), where the plugin hasn\u0027t yet been released (because it cannot update its GWT dependencies yet).\n\nWDYT?",
