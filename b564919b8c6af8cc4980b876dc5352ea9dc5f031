      "message": "I have some misgivings about the whole approach in JsNameSpaceChooser. This was a hack already for SDM.\n\nWhat I don\u0027t like about this is that now the qualified name concept (that was already there for JsNameRefs) is also in JsName. I know you did not design this pass, but now that is a general pass I think it should be redesigned.\n\nI propose:\n  1) get rid of the namespace JsName in JsName\n  2) compute the mapping (as done here) from JsName to JsName namespace.\n  3) run a global JsVisitor pass that adds the qualifiers appropriately.\n\nAm I missing a reason why it shouldn\u0027t be done this way?\n\nAlso the fragment/code splitter code is kind of duplicated in many places. We should look at those and simplify instead of adding an extra layer. I think the handling of fragments should be done in one place not split between JsNamespaceChooser and HandleCrossFragmentReferences.",
