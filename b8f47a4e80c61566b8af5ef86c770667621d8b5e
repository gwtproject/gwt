      "message": "Because I had no idea that it would make a difference to closure string obfuscation :). Wouldn\u0027t closure obfuscate each string in the array?  If that is the case we will just be leaking a bit of info (i.e. that the class is an innerclass of some class).\n\nI prefer the array as it is a bit cleaner but we can change it to \"/\" if it really makes a difference.",
