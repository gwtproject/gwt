      "message": "I still think we need to ignore calls to constructors of this class or super constructors and also $init. IRC most constructors will include either of these calls. We can also safely ignore parameterless static calls (and that would include the $clinit that is inserted by the inliner) that are also pretty common in constructors.",

      "message": "Parameterless static calls seem safe, but for constructors, it seems like we have to visit them to know whether they\u0027re safe?\n\nPerhaps we could construct a set of locally-safe constructors and a constructor call graph, which can be used to calculate the transitive closure. It should be linear for constructor calls.",

      "message": "Roberto: Ignoring calls to cstrs of this/super makes sense--they will get their own endVisit checks. $init I will look in to. Ignoring 0-arg static calls makes sense too.\n\nBrian: I believe what Roberto is saying is that the other cstr calls will have their contents checked by their own visit(JConstructor)/endVisit(JMethodCall)s, so if we see a method call from 1 cstr to another cstr in the same class, we can assume it will get checked later, and the cstr-\u003ecstr call itself doesn\u0027t mean we have to mark the currentClass as observing subclass fields.",
