      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should call gwtSetUp() first because then we won\u0027t have any uncaught exception handler installed when it\u0027s running, and those errors should be reported too.\n\nI\u0027m also not convinced that we should allow user code to install an uncaught exception handler within gwtSetUp(). The original bug was complaining that error reporting should be better, not that they actually wanted to do this. Instead, how about this?\n\n- assert uncaught handler is null\n- install our own uncaught handler\n- run gwtSetUp()\n- Assert that our own uncaught handler is still installed.\n\nWe could also do assertions before and after running the test and gwtTearDown() to make sure no changes happen there either.\n\nOr perhaps we could even modify GWT.setUncaughtExceptionHandler() to allow us to internally disable it while the test is running. (That is, it should fail fast when called during a GWTTestCase, except for GWTTestCase itself.)\n\nOr is there a good reason for a test to install an uncaught handler?",

      "message": "I agree that we should report errors from gwtSetup, I missed that.\nHowever, we cannot assert if uncaught handler is null as it will potentially break projects that already have an uncaught handler intentionally or not. Unfortunately it is not always in the control of the developer as reported in the bug. On the other hand, some test cases may potentially depend on an error being reported by uncaught handler; especially in more integration style test cases.\n\nSo ideally, we should not put restrictions here and we should avoid any side effects. That is, we will be just \u0027spying\u0027 and test cases we will work exactly same with or without our handlers. That would require to have GWT#addUncaughtHandler instead of GWT#setUncaughtHandler but that is a much bigger change.\n\nGiving it a second thought, perhaps, we should not even touch anything if the developer has some handlers already set. Because with the original behavior, developers were being able to opt-out from \u0027test cases failing due to uncaught hander being called\u0027 by setting their own handler. I changed that and it doesn\u0027t look like a good idea to me now.\n\nFor now, we can do the best effort to have minimal side effect:\n{\n  ensureUncaughtHandler() // install our own uncaught handler that also calls the original\n  gwtSetup();\n}\n\nI think this is fairly good solution and improvement as\n - developer can still opt-out from our handlers\n - less side effects (original handler will not be lost )\n\nOptionally, we can expose ensureUncaughtHandler so that developers will have an option to add handlers back if a code out of their control has changed it or needs to change it.\n\nWhat do you think?",
