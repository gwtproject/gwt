      "message": "I don\u0027t think we should call gwtSetUp() first because then we won\u0027t have any uncaught exception handler installed when it\u0027s running, and those errors should be reported too.\n\nI\u0027m also not convinced that we should allow user code to install an uncaught exception handler within gwtSetUp(). The original bug was complaining that error reporting should be better, not that they actually wanted to do this. Instead, how about this?\n\n- assert uncaught handler is null\n- install our own uncaught handler\n- run gwtSetUp()\n- Assert that our own uncaught handler is still installed.\n\nWe could also do assertions before and after running the test and gwtTearDown() to make sure no changes happen there either.\n\nOr perhaps we could even modify GWT.setUncaughtExceptionHandler() to allow us to internally disable it while the test is running. (That is, it should fail fast when called during a GWTTestCase, except for GWTTestCase itself.)\n\nOr is there a good reason for a test to install an uncaught handler?",
