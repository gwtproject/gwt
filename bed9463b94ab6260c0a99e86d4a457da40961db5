      "message": "Good question :-)\n\nI have absolutely no idea how api_checker works (I already looked at it a couple times but forget everything about it as soon as I stop looking at it)\n\nFrom https://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/wiki/ApiChecker_User_Guide (which we should really all check from time to time: it seems like we didn\u0027t follow the process when creating this file), I think we should actually simply list com.google.gwt.resources.client.impl in excludedPackages. excludedFiles are about excluding those files that are not \"translatable\" to JS by GWT, so it should exclude all rebind or server code, and those classes that have a super-sourced version.\n\nI\u0027ll make the change.",

      "message": "Here we\u0027re changing Image so that it\u0027ll use an UnclippedState when initialized with an ImageResource that isStandalone, whereas previously it would unconditionally use a ClippedState when initialized with an ImageResource (as opposed to a URL).\n\nPreviously, with the ClippedState, the image would be rendered using innerHTML and its dimensions set within style\u003d\"\" (from ClippedImageImpl); whereas the UnclippedState sets the ImageElement\u0027s width and height properties.\n\nI confirmed in a small test with ImageElement that getOffsetWidth returns 1256 there even though getWidth returns 56 (the value I had passed to setWidth). This is independent from the image being loaded. I also tried deferring the asserts with Scheduler#scheduleDeferred and it didn\u0027t change anything.\n\nUsing getStyle().setWidth(56, Unit.PX) fixes getOffsetWidth, but now getWidth returns 24 (a hard-coded value).\n\nSo, should we change UnclippedState to use getStyle().setWidth() or do we simply declare a bug in HTMLUnit and disable the tests? (i.e. what I\u0027ve done here, but maybe change it Platform.HtmlUnitBug))",
