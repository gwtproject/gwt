      "message": "Marginally off topic, but not all JSO code actually is okay with \u0027this\u0027 being null - if the compiler decides that a JSO is null always null then even calls like .cast() (which should be just syntactic sugar and can\u0027t fail on anything, right?) will be replaced with null.nullMethod(). Is that a) desired behavior (in which cast your null check can also be added here) or b) considered a bug?",

      "message": "Actually, I was thinking that perhaps we could introduce an @AllowNullThis annotation and put it on methods like cast() where we rely on such trickery. It would be better documentation of what\u0027s currently an obscure practice. But it might be hard to find and update all the places where we do that.\n\nFor now I\u0027m hoping that excluding all JSO\u0027s is sufficient. It seems like non-JSO code that relies on a null \"this\" would have failed in Dev Mode before, so it should be rare?",
