      "message": "Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nThis makes the compiler happy on the surface but technically not correct because of two reasons:\n1. We are basically saying type will be inferred from caller, however as the type is called via reflection, that is not true.\n2. Even there was no reflection, there is still no way for service implementation to infer the return type to work correctly.\n\nThe root cause of all of this is; the way this RPC interface is defined; it is not possible to implement a realistic service from it. At the end this is for just checking if GWT-RPC code generator works properly with recursive definition and other stuff will distract and confuse the reader.\n\nOn the other hand, interestingly this causes code generator for the GWTTestCase to generate code that doesn\u0027t compile. Not sure about the exact cause but it is related to generics. \n\nI\u0027m reverting it back to raw types...",
