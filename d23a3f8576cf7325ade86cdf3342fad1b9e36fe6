      "message": "Perhaps we should say something about units. \"If the value represents a duration then it will be in milliseconds.\"\n\nAlso, are multiple calls to logMetric() with the same name allowed? (That is, will the result be a Map or a Multimap?)\n\nTo make reporting easier, we might also want to restrict the characters to be used in keys to those matching a regexp: \"The key is a list of identifiers separated by dots, such as \"Compiler.time\". Identifiers may contain the characters \"[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_\". And put an assertion somewhere so we remember to do this.",
