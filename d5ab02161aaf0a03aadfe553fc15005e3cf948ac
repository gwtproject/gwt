The user will reload the page if they get impatient. If they want to be patient, we should probably let them.\n\nShowing some progress in the dialog and having a cancel button would help the user know whether they should still wait. But it would complicate the protocol. I\u0027m hoping incremental compiles will fix this by making things faster.",

Perhaps if there is no callback argument on the recompile URL and no user agent, it should serve a web page that sniffs the user agent and shows a compile button?",
