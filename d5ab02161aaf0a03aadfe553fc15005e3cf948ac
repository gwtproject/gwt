The user will reload the page if they get impatient. If they want to be patient, we should probably let them.\n\nShowing some progress in the dialog and having a cancel button would help the user know whether they should still wait. But it would complicate the protocol. I\u0027m hoping incremental compiles will fix this by making things faster.",

      "message": "I think they know already that it\u0027s taking a long time. :-) We should tell them something they don\u0027t already know.\n\nMaybe the simplest approach would be a URL to poll periodically to find out the compiler\u0027s progress. It could return JSON like {\"status\": \"compiling something\", \"finished\": 2, \"total\": 5} to indicate that it\u0027s finished 2 steps out of 5, or {\"status\": \"idle\"} if it isn\u0027t doing anything. Of course if the web page polls the server and gets no answer, that\u0027s useful to know too.\n\nBut in any case I think we shouldn\u0027t do this yet, and fix it in another patch.",
