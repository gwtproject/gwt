      "message": "We cannot assume this is the XPath, as this code is used from many different places and this would likely cause silent corruption in a future CLDR update that changed a path we rely on.\n\nRather than checking the path here and setting a default, I would prefer to pass a default value into this method (default null, probably with a helper so callers that don\u0027t care about a default can be unchanged), and logic like:\n\nMap\u003cString, String\u003e attr \u003d null;\nif (fullPath !\u003d null) {\n  parts.set(fullPath);\n  attr \u003d parts.findAttributes(tag);\n}\nString value;\nif (attr \u003d\u003d null) {\n  if (defaultValue \u003d\u003d null) {\n    return;\n  }\n  value \u003d defaultValue;\n} else {\n  value \u003d attr.get(attribute);\n}\nmap.put(key, value);\n\nI structured the code this way to preserve existing behavior around the tag not being present versus being present but having no value -- I don\u0027t remember exactly, but I believe that will result in blocking inheritance from a parent locale.",
