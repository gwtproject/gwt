Shouldn\u0027t it be used here?\n\nOr actually, shouldn\u0027t the private \"partition methods\" return type be returnType.getParameterizedQualifiedSourceName() (i.e. possibly a primitive type, never a wrapper type, contrary to returnTypeName), and then yes reintroduce the \u0027tmp\u0027 variable with the same type (*not* returnTypeName)\n\nThis calls for moar tests.",
