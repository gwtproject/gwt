      "message": "\u003e websocket-server and websocket-api are not needed?\n\nActually not. Server-side websocket in Jetty is actually enabled through a ServletContainerInitializer, so if we don\u0027t include those, Jetty simply won\u0027t support WebSockets, and including the dependencies in the classpath should \"automagically\" add WebSocket support.\n\n\u003e I had much more deoendencies in my attempt to unbounde Jetty\n\nYeah, you basically flattened all dependencies, whereas I\u0027m relying on transitive dependencies AND I only picked the few dependencies that DevMode and CodeServer actually need. I basically looked at the dependencies that are bundled within the jetty-all JAR [1] and trimmed them down.\n\nI verified DevMode was still working by deploying to my local repo (maven/push-gwt.sh) and running the DynatableRf sample.\n\n\n* [1] https://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Corg.eclipse.jetty.aggregate%7Cjetty-all%7C9.2.14.v20151106%7Cjar",
