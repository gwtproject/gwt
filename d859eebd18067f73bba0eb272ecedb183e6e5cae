Change generatePrimaryFragmentString() to only call getModuleSuffix(logger, context, strongName).\n\n3. Mark getModuleSuffix(Logger, LinkerContext) as @Deprecated and to instruct users to override this method instead.",

      "message": "There are subclasses that override getModuleSuffix() and expected to get called by generatePrimaryFragmentString(), so that would break unless generateModuleSuffix(l, ctx, name) called the 2-arg version (as I see you proposed in the other file). Another option is to refactor the Google linkers that override it.\n\nThese overrides were specifically added so that sourcemaps could be adjusted by knowing what the linker was pre-pending to the module. Chances are not many external users override it.",
