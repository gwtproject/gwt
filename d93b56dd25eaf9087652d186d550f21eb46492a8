      "message": "That means that you have to:\n\n* download GWT separately from what Maven already does (either as an Eclipse plugin, or the SDK and then configuring Eclipse to recognize it)\n* make sure to keep the GWT version in your Eclipse project and the POM in sync\n* run \"mvn eclipse:eclipse\" every time you change your POM before you can refresh the project in Eclipse to pick up the changes\n\nâ€¦when M2E on the other hand could just import the project, and the GPE+M2E-integration automatically configure GPE to use the JARs that Maven just downloaded, and always keep everything in sync (so updating GWT is only a matter of changing the gwtVersion property in your POM and letting everything reconfigure itself automatically; same when changing other dependencies).\n\nI\u0027d favor the simplest process and ditch the maven-eclipse-plugin.\n\nMoreover, WebAppCreator means you already have downloaded the GWT SDK so if you use the -maven flag it probably means you\u0027re new to Maven, so the simplest the better: generate the project, import it as a Maven project in Eclipse (i.e. using M2E, which is bundled in Eclipse for a couple years now, so it doesn\u0027t even requires an additional download) and you\u0027re done.",
