So \"you don\u0027t need m2eclipse\" is not a compelling argument.\n\nBut OK to leave the eclipse:eclipse plugin config here, assuming the Google Plugin for Eclipse works OK with that config (i.e. no GWT_CONTAINER classpathContainer, just the GWT jars in the build path). I\u0027m opposed to configuring a GWT_CONTAINER like done in gwt-site-webapp though.\n\nShould we leave the comment about AspectJ then?

Once the project is built with mvn eclipse:eclipse, you can not update the maven project in Eclipse using maven update. You have to manually do this on the command line.. I\u0027ve always found m2e import does a better job with setting up the project and document that in all my documents. And since Eclipse is being used, its all IDE, so import maven project, and update maven project, no need for any command line to import gwt project into eclipse, and if it needs to be fixed, thats easy re-import the project. :)",

Since m2eclipse became m2e some years ago they change the strategy and removed that feature, they had good reasons for it though. AFAIK, right now, for automatically adding gwt nature and builder automatically is running eclipse:eclipse, otherwise if you import the project with m2e, you have to setup manually the google plugin.\n\nThe way gwt-site-webapp does it makes sense to me, I\u0027d rather the eclipse:eclipse way instead of m2e, since I dont want eclipse tasks running inside eclipse.\n\nI have asked some teams and there are people using both ways.
