Some experienced fellow from core GWT team should dig his/her memory why it was left as is.\n\nIf I remember correctly, which is highly unlikely as I just returned from vacation, there was other similar places as well where IE9 permutation looks to be using unnecessary hacks. It would definitely be good for GWT-IE combo to clean up all these legacy hacks, but IMO it is not sane to do this all under same issue. My motivation is for IE10 (due to mobile usage), but even there we should be progressing in smaller steps rather than trying to fix/optimize everything in a single patch.",
