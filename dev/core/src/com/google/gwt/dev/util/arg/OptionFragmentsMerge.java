  // 1. Magically decide the number of fragments to merge. (May be too hard)
  // 2. All the user to specify number of fragments they want to *keep* instead
  //    of the number they want to merge.
  // 3. Ask the user what is the max (average) size of fragments. (This
  //    can only be an estimated.
