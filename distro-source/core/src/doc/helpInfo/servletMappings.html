<title>Servlet Mappings, GWT Modules, and web.xml</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>GWT modules may declare one or more <code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code>
tags. These define Java Servlets that implement the server-side
component of a GWT-enabled web application.</p>

<p>In modern GWT applications, these are only used for testing, and it is
discouraged to use them in application code.</p>

<p>During hosted mode startup, the set of expected servlets (from GWT module
<code>&lt;servlet&gt;</code> tags) is validated against the set of actual
servlets (from the <code>WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) and a warning is issued for
each expected servlet which does not match an actual servlet.
