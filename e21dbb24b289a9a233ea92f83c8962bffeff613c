      "message": "Not sure I like it but kind of depends what is the general stance for emulated code. If JavaDoc states a NullPointer should be thrown then IMHO it should really be a Java NullPointerException and not a JavaScriptException. That means instead of catching both exceptions here I would add checkNotNull() in Optional.ifPresent() instead. Same for the other methods. What do you guys think?",
