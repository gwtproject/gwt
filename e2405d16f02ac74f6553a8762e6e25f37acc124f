      "message": "Hmm so you are allowing all constructors now on these types (also in next else-if below)? Are you sure this is correct? Currently, without this CL applied, something like\n\n  @java.lang.Double::new(Ljava/lang/String;)(\"123\")\n\nis allowed but\n\n   @java.lang.String::new(Ljava/lang/String;)(\"other\")\n\nis disallowed. With your change the String constructor would now be allowed? I guess its a good idea to also add some tests for ::new in JsniRestrictionCheckerTest.",
