      "message": "Sorry, I made a bad suggestion since I wasn\u0027t thinking that clearing the cache affects all modules. Instead of the semaphore, I thought of a better way to do this:\n\nJobRunner has a single threaded executor. We\u0027re using this to make sure we don\u0027t execute more than one job at a time.\n\nSo, maybe we should have a JobRunner.clean() method which submits a task to the task queue and blocks until it finishes? (It can just submit a Callable.)\n\nSorry about that, but I\u0027d rather not have two different ways to do mutual exclusion.",
