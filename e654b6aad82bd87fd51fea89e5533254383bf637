      "message": "Where is the stableness check? Calling assertEquals(expected, array) does not detect stableness because e21 and e22 are equal and assertEquals() will call equals() on them. So their order does not matter. I am pretty sure your test does not fail if you swap e21 and e22 manually in expected array.\n\nYou would need to use \u003d\u003d and check the specific indexes to make sure that e21 and e22 have not swapped places after sort.",
