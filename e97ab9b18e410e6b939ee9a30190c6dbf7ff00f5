I worry that every Java string concat in GWT that doesn\u0027t use StringBuffer/Builder is going to hit this method (\"foo \" + a). \n\nSeems to me that this\u0027ll expand \"\" + x in JS to something much bigger in GWT because of EqualityNormalizer if it inlines. Perhaps it needs a @DoNotInline.\n\nIdeally you\u0027d want something like x \u0026\u0026 \"\" + x || \"null\";",
