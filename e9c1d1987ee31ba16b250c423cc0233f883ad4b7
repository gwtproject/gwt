      "message": "Hm, okay, I see now.  I think this whole comment could be simplified to something like:\n\n    We must canonicalize the path here, otherwise we might set cacheDirectory to\n    something like \"/path/to/nonexistent/../gwt-unitCache\".  If this were to happen, the\n    mkdirs() call below would only create \"/path/to/gwt-unitCache\" and further accesses\n    via the uncanonicalized path would fail.\n    \n    Fixes issue 6443.\n\nDo you think that still accurately conveys the bug/fix?",
