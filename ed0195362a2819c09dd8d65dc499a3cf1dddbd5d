      "message": "Actually, Core already depends on TypedArrays; through XMLHttpRequest for GWT.runAsync. See https://plus.google.com/113945685385052458154/posts/PCQ1AGzBECi\n\nIn retrospect, I think TypedArrays support in XHR should have been added generically (i.e. using generics) rather than directly depending on TypedArrays; but it\u0027s a bit too late, and if Core already needs TypedArrays for better arryas, then there\u0027\u0027s no reason to remove it from XHR.",

      "message": "Thanks for that - I had noticed that the precompile tasks did not fail when running the unit tests, but assumed that it was a module inter-dependency issue, or I failed to set up the run correctly. In the interest of *future* clean dependencies, I\u0027d still be interested in factoring this out, but we\u0027d need to decide if it was worth the mess of re-declaring an Array supersource in another module.",
