      "message": "\"loads symbol and source map files from a URL beneath the given parent.\"\n\nThis seems rather dicy. We will end up doing two HTTP requests for each file (one for the symbol map and another for the source map). If the file doesn\u0027t exist, there\u0027s only one request, but still someone could use this API as a way to do a denial-of-service attack on whichever server we\u0027re loading the files from. Maybe leave out this constructor for now?",

It seems like reporting a simple log message (not a full stack trace) for the first few missing files would make it easier to fix configuration errors, instead of dropping all IOExceptions silently like we do now. And if it\u0027s not just a missing file then I think it deserves a full stack trace.\n\nSo perhaps we should have a specific exception for a normal file not found error, so we can catch it separately?",
