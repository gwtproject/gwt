      "message": "\u003e Are these the methods meant to be used by end users?\n\nThis will be only used by a few third-parties like adding MS prefixed pointer events - not meant to be used by app developers.\n\nI kind of remember setting it to public but can\u0027t remember why I took it back. I\u0027ll check it again.\n\n\u003e It also seems like it won\u0027t work if a non-DOMImplStandard-based \n\nThat is the idea. This is used for adding new generation of events that are recently added (or might be added in the future).",

Will let you know how it turns out.",
