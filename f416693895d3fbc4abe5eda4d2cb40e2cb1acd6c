      "message": "The goal is good, but not wild about the name. I think we should avoid \"shared\" unless it\u0027s code that we intend to share between client and server. Also, it should be something that implies a bit more strongly that it\u0027s private to GWT. Some candidates:\n\n com.google.gwt.internal\n com.google.gwt.internal.common\n\nBut since this package already exists, we can deal with that some other time.",
