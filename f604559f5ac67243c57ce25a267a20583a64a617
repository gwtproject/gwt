      "message": "This should be a critical check because the binary search algorithm will not fail with any JS exception but instead give wrong answers that would affect other algorithms using binary search. Think of from \u003e to (results in -from-1, which means \"not found, should be inserted at from-1), or search intervals which causes \"mid\" to be outside of sortedArray so that \"midValue\" becomes undefined and \"mid\" would be returned as the if comparisons will all be false.\n\nA checkNotNull() is not needed as the code will fail anyways because of sortedArray.length call.",
