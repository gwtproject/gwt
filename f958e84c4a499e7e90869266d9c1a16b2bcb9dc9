      "message": "Couldn\u0027t we (also) make isProdMode different from isScript? I see no reason to have those two properties as exact synonyms; Super Dev Mode should IMO be isScript but !isProdMode:\n\n                isClient isScript isProdMode\n plain JVM         -        -         -\n Dev Mode          Y        -         -\n Super Dev Mode    Y        Y         -\n prod mode         Y        Y         Y\n\nSee also issue 7634.\n\nIf that change is eventually made, then this test should become:\n\n if (isScript() \u0026\u0026 !isProdMode())\n\nAnd then the \"calls are optimized out in production mode\" comments below would be accurate.\n\nWe could even have the value of isProdMode dependent on a configuration-property or command-line switch; that SuperDevMode would always override. That way, one could compile and deploy a \"dev\" version of his application, that logs GWT.log to the console, and enables a few other things dependent on isProdMode in the code.",
