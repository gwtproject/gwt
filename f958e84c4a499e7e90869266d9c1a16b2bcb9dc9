I see no reason to have those two properties as exact synonyms; Super Dev Mode should IMO be isScript but !isProdMode:\n\n                isClient isScript isProdMode\n plain JVM         -        -         -\n Dev Mode          Y        -         -\n Super Dev Mode    Y        Y         -\n prod mode         Y        Y         Y\n\nSee also issue 7634.\n\nIf that change is eventually made, then this test should become:\n\n if (isScript() \u0026\u0026 !isProdMode())\n\nAnd then the \"calls are optimized out in production mode\" comments below would be accurate.\n\nWe could even have the value of isProdMode dependent on a configuration-property or command-line switch; that SuperDevMode would always override. That way, one could compile and deploy a \"dev\" version of his application, that logs GWT.log to the console, and enables a few other things dependent on isProdMode in the code.",

Thinking of plain-jvm always as non-production mode doesn\u0027t sound right to me.\n\nThe special mode here is being in \"dev mode or not\" instead of \"prod or not\" so we can introduce is isDevMode and then what it will return will be obvious all modes.
