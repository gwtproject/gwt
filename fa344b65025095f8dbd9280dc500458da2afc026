      "message": "Net result of restoring errorprone is that other compile errors happen in tests (when combined with merging java7 and java8 tests). This led me to understand that adding additional flags is going to make sense to prevent those issues, which I\u0027ve done in this latest patch, which in turn lets the error-prone-ant build be put back to what it was before, which lets me skip the other two new required additional flags...\n\nSo, errorprone is the compiler again, error-prone-ant is unchanged (until we explicitly update to a modern version, which ideally will prepare us for Java 11/17), and an extra errorprone compiler flag is being passed.\n\nant dist has passed https://github.com/niloc132/gwt/runs/3908186521, waiting on the full build now to confirm that all tests are indeed happy with this setup, but the user tests have started which is where most of the work has gone in this: https://github.com/niloc132/gwt/runs/3908186403",
