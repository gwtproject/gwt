      "message": "If we go that route, we have to move LogConfiguration to a \u0027shared\u0027 package too (for consistency; we said server-side code should never call *.client.* classes), and find a way to have it only reference *.shared.* code (splitting the Impl maybe, so that configureClientSideLogging only exists in a *.client.* class).\nI\u0027d still find it easier (to read and maintain) to use a GWT.isClient() check here though, whether we move to \u0027shared\u0027 or not.\n\nA simpler route would be to add null checks in LogConfiguration\u0027s loggingIsEnabled to make it work with GWTMockUtilities; and possibly move LogConfiguration to \u0027shared\u0027 later.\n\nWhat do you think we should aim at here?\n\nI\u0027ve gone the simpler route for now.",
