      "message": "FYI, jar.bydate didn\u0027t actually use that value, as its goal was to always pick the newest of each duplicate path.\n\nThe problem with \"fail\" is that there are a whole bunch of duplicates in the dependencies we bundle inside gwt-dev.jar (starting with org/apache/COPYING, META-INF/LICENSE and the like), and we also replace a couple of classes from Tomcat and Eclipse JDT with our own patched versions.\n\nI\u0027ve thus reverted to \"fail\" as the default, changed \u003cgwt.jar destfile\u003d\"${alldeps.jar}\"\u003e to use duplicates\u003d\"preserve\" (removing a few obvious duplicates as I was at it), and explicitly excluded those files that we replace with our own in the \u003cgwt.jar\u003e for gwt-dev.jar.",
