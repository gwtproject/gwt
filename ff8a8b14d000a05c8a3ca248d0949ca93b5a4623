It should behave the same but be slightly easier to read (and similarly for classToWhatItDependsOn and packageToClasses, and dependencies could be a Table\u003cString,String,String\u003e).\n\nAnd numSplitPoint seems to be equal to splitPointToLocation.keySet().size()\n\nIt might have a (negative) impact on compilation performance, I don\u0027t know, so feel free to disregard this comment.",

I\u0027ll defer to the other reviewers w.r.t. this issue.\n\nIn any case I don\u0027t think this part of the code is performance sensitive and IIRC most big applications have only a handful of splitpoints (50, 100) so the map is pretty small.\n\nYou are right numSplitPoints \u003d\u003d splitPointLocation.size().",
