/**
 * JsProperty marks a method in a {@link JsType} as a property accessor and recognizes JavaBean
 * style naming convention. Instead of translating method calls to JsProperty methods as method
 * calls in JS, they will be replaced with dotted property lookups.
 * <p>
 * In case of JsType with JsProperties implemented by Java classes, the property access still
 * triggers the execution of the matching getter or setter methods as they will be translated into
 * custom property setter and getter in JavaScript.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty getX()} translates as <tt>this.x</tt>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty x()} translates as <tt>this.x</tt>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty setX(int y)} translates as <tt>this.x=y</tt>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty x(int x)} translates as <tt>this.x=y</tt>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty hasX(int x)} translates as <tt>x in this</tt>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In addition, fluent style <tt>return this</tt> syntax is supported for setters, so
 * {@code @JsProperty T setX(int x)} translates as <tt>this.x=x, return this</tt>.
