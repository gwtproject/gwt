<!-- Defines GWT-translatable versions of the JUnit 3 classes, such as
junit.framework.Assert.

Normally you don't need to inherit this module. It isn't necessary when using
GWTTestCase, and these classes shouldn't be used in production web apps. But
you might need it if you're writing testing tools. -->
