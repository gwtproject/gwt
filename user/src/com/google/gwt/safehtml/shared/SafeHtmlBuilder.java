/**
 * A builder that facilitates the building up of XSS-safe HTML from text
 * snippets. It is used essentially like a {@link StringBuilder}; unlike a
 * {@link StringBuilder}, it automatically HTML-escapes appended input where
 * necessary.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition, it supports methods that allow strings with HTML markup to be
 * appended without escaping: One can append other {@link SafeHtml} objects, and
 * one can append constant strings. The method that appends constant strings
 * ({@link #appendHtmlConstant(String)}) requires a convention of use to be
 * adhered to in order for this class to adhere to the contract required by
 * {@link SafeHtml}: The argument expression must be fully determined and known
 * to be safe at compile time, and the value of the argument must not contain
 * incomplete HTML tags. See {@link #appendHtmlConstant(String)} for details.
 *
 * <p>
 * The accumulated XSS-safe HTML can be obtained in the form of a
 * {@link SafeHtml} via the {@link #toSafeHtml()} method.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class is not thread-safe.

   * <ol>
   *
   * <li>The argument expression must be fully determined at compile time.
   *
   * <li>The value of the argument must end in "inner HTML" context and not
   * contain incomplete HTML tags. I.e., the following is not a correct use of
   * this method, because the {@code <a>} tag is incomplete:
   *
   * <pre class="code">
   * {@code shb.appendConstantHtml("<a href='").append(url)}</pre>
   *
   * </ol>
   *
   * <p>
   * The first constraint provides a sufficient condition that the appended
   * string (and any HTML markup contained in it) originates from a trusted
   * source. The second constraint ensures the composability of {@link SafeHtml}
   * values.
   *
   * <p>
   * When executing client-side in Development Mode, or server-side with
   * assertions enabled, the argument is HTML-parsed and validated to satisfy
   * the second constraint (the server-side check can also be enabled
   * programmatically, see
   * {@link SafeHtmlHostedModeUtils#maybeCheckCompleteHtml(String)} for
   * details). For performance reasons, this check is not performed in prod mode
   * on the client, and with assertions disabled on the server.
   *
   * @param html the HTML snippet to be appended
   * @return a reference to this object
   * @throws IllegalArgumentException if not running in prod mode and {@code
   *           html} violates the second constraint
