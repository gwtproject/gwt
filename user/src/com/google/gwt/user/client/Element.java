/**
 * An opaque handle to a native DOM Element. An <code>Element</code> cannot be
 * created directly. Instead, use the <code>Element</code> type when returning
 * a native DOM element from JSNI methods. An <code>Element</code> passed back
 * into JSNI becomes the original DOM element the <code>Element</code> was
 * created from, and can be accessed in JavaScript code as expected. This is
 * typically done by calling methods in the
 * {@link com.google.gwt.user.client.DOM} class.
 * <p>
 * As of GWT 2.6, users should use {@link com.google.gwt.dom.client.Element}
 * instead.  As an exception, some methods still return a <code>Element</code>
 * object for backwards compatibility (though this will change in a future
 * release), so overriding them will require returning an <code>Element</code>
 * object too.
