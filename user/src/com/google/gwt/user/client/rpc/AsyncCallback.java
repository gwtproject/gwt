/**
 * The primary interface a caller must implement to receive a response from a
 * remote procedure call.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If an RPC is successful, then {@link #onSuccess(Object)} is called, otherwise
 * {@link #onFailure(Throwable)} is called.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Each callable asynchronous method corresponds to a method in the correlated
 * service interface. The asynchronous method always takes an
 * <code>AsyncCallback&lt;T&gt;</code> as its last parameter, where
 * <code>T</code> is the return type of the correlated synchronous method.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As an example, suppose the service interface defines a method called
 * <code>getShapes</code> as follows:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Shape[] getShapes(String databaseName) throws ShapeException, DbException;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Its asynchronous counterpart method be declared as:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void getShapes(String databaseName, AsyncCallback&lt;Shape[]&gt; callback);
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Note that <code>throws</code> declaration is not repeated in the async
 * version.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A call with a typical use of <code>AsyncCallback</code> might look like
 * this:
 * 
 * <pre class="code">
 * service.getShapes(dbName, new AsyncCallback<Shape[]>() {
 *   public void onSuccess(Shape[] result) {
 *     // It's always safe to downcast to the known return type. 
 *     controller.processShapes(result);
 *   }
 * 
 *   public void onFailure(Throwable caught) {
 *     // Convenient way to find out which exception was thrown.
 *     try {
 *       throw caught;
 *     } catch (IncompatibleRemoteServiceException e) {
 *       // this client is not compatible with the server; cleanup and refresh the 
 *       // browser
 *     } catch (InvocationException e) {
 *       // the call didn't complete cleanly
 *     } catch (ShapeException e) {
 *       // one of the 'throws' from the original method
 *     } catch (DbException e) {
 *       // one of the 'throws' from the original method
 *     } catch (Throwable e) {
 *       // last resort -- a very unexpected exception
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <T> The type of the return value that was declared in the synchronous
 *          version of the method. If the return type is a primitive, use the
 *          boxed version of that primitive (for example, an <code>int</code>
 *          return type becomes an {@link Integer} type argument, and a
 *          <code>void</code> return type becomes a {@link Void} type
 *          argument, which is always <code>null</code>).
