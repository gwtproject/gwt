   * {@link SuggestOracle#isDisplayStringHTML()}. The replacement string is the
   * string that is entered into the SuggestBox's text box when the suggestion
   * is selected from the list.
   * 
   * <p>
   * Replacement strings are useful when the display form of a suggestion
   * differs from the input format for the data. For example, suppose that a
   * company has a webpage with a form which requires the user to enter the
   * e-mail address of an employee. Since users are likely to know the name of
   * the employee, a SuggestBox is used to provide name suggestions as the user
   * types. When the user types the letter <i>f</i>, a suggestion with the
   * display string <i>foo bar</i> appears. When the user chooses this
   * suggestion, the replacement string, <i>foobar@company.com</i>, is entered
   * into the SuggestBox's text box.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <p>
   * This is an example where the input data format for the suggestion is not as
   * user-friendly as the display format. In the event that the display of a
   * suggestion exactly matches the input data format, the
   * <code>Suggestion</code> interface would be implemented in such a way that
   * the display string and replacement string would be identical.
   * </p>
   * 
   * <h3>Associating Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) with Suggestion Objects</h3>
   * Some applications retrieve suggesstions from a server, and may want to send
   * back a DTO with each suggestion. In the previous example, a DTO returned
   * with the suggestion may provide additional contact information about the
   * selected employee, and this information could be used to fill out other
   * fields on the form. To send back a DTO with each suggestion, extend the
   * <code>Suggestion</code> interface and define a getter method that has a
   * return value of the DTO's type. Define a class that implements this
   * subinterface and use it to encapsulate each suggestion.
   * 
   * <p>
   * To access a suggestion's DTO when the suggestion is selected, add a
   * {@link com.google.gwt.event.logical.shared.SelectionHandler} to the SuggestBox
   * (see SuggestBox's documentation for more information). In the
   * <code>SelectionHandler.onSelection(SelectionEvent&lt;Suggestion&gt; event)</code>
   * method, obtain the selected <code>Suggestion</code> object from the
   * {@link com.google.gwt.event.logical.shared.SelectionEvent} object, and downcast
   * the <code>Suggestion</code> object to the subinterface. Then, acces the DTO
   * using the DTO getter method that was defined on the subinterface.
