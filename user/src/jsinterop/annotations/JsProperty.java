/**
 * JsProperty marks a field in a type as a method that will be directly translated into a JavaScript
 * property without any obfuscation to its name.
 * <p>
 * If it is applied to a method, it will be treated as a property accessor. As a result, instead of
 * translating method calls to JsProperty methods as method calls in JS, they will be translated as
 * property lookups. When a JsProperty method implemented by a Java class, such methods will be
 * generated as custom property setter and getter in JavaScript, hence the property access will
 * trigger the execution of the matching getter or setter methods.
 * <p>
 * JsProperty follows JavaBean style naming convention to extract the default property name. If the
 * JavaBean convention is not followed, the name should be set explicitly. For example:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty getX()} or {@code @JsProperty isX()} translates as <tt>this.x</tt>
 * <li> {@code @JsProperty setX(int y)} translates as <tt>this.x=y</tt>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that, while non-static member are slotted in the prototype, static members will be defined
 * under the constructor function of the type.
