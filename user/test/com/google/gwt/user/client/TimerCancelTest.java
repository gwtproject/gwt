     * It seems that IE adds an event to the javascript event loop immediately when a timer expires
     * (supposedly from a separate thread). After this has happened, canceling the timer has no
     * effect because it is already in the queue and no further checks are done when running the
     * event once it reaches the head of the queue.
     *
     * This means that to trigger the bug, we must ensure the timer has been added to the event loop
     * queue before it is canceled. To ensure this happens, we will busy wait until both timers
     * should have fired. This means the following happens:
     *
     * 1) While busy waiting, IE adds events for each timer to the event loop
     *
     * 2) IE pumps the event loop, running the helper timer that cancels the tested timer. This does
     * however not have any effect because the timer is already in the event loop queue.
     *
     * 3) IE pumps the event loop again and runs the event for the tested timer, without realizing
     * that it has been canceled.
     *
     * Without busy waiting, the tested timer would not yet have been added to the event loop queue
     * at the point when the timer is canceled, in which case canceling the timer would work as
     * expected.
     *
     * If the two timers are not scheduled in the same order that they will run, it seems that IE
     * does some additional checks that makes the problem disappear.
