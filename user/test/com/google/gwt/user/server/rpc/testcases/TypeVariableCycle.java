/**
 * An example of how to create a cycle using type variable inference. To determine
 * the expected type of the HELLO.ptr field, the type inference in
 * {@link com.google.gwt.user.server.rpc.impl.SerializabilityUtil}
 * starts with PtrPtr.ptr and deduces the following:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>C = B (by inheritance)
 *   <li>B = A (by inheritance)
 *   <li>A = C (because the raw type of ptr is BasePtr&lt;A&gt; and we are substituting C into it)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>If we put these deductions into a map then there will be a cycle in the map.
 * The type inferencer needs to detect the cycle and conclude that there is no constraint
 * on any of these type variables, so HELLO.ptr.target could be any serializable
 * type.</p>
 *
 * <p>TODO(skybrian): it's unclear whether this should really be a cycle. The 'A' in the second
 * deduction annotates the the PtrPtr object (HELLO) and the 'A' in the last deduction is for the
 * SimplePtr object (HELLO.ptr) so perhaps they are two type variables of the same name in different
 * scopes? Currently the algorithm in SerializabilityUtil doesn't have scopes so this might
 * just be a false alias. It doesn't affect the conclusion for this example, though.</p>
